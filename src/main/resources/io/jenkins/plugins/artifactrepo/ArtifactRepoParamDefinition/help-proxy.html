        When checked it allows to define an HTTP proxy to be used for the outgoing connections.
    </p>
    <i>
        Please note that when this option is unchecked but a global proxy is defined the connection
        will make use of the global proxy settings. If both the local and global proxy settings are
        set
        the local proxy settings take precedence.
